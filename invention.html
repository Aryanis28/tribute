    <h1>Mentioned below are some of the Einstein's Inventions:</h1>
    <h1><br><br>  Avogadro’s Number</h1>

      <h1>  Avogadro’s number is a concept in chemistry that defines that the number of units in one mole of a substance is equal to 6.022140857×1023
        
        The Avogadro constant is named after the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro. It is the proportionality factor defined by Albert Einstein to relate the number of constituent particles like molecules, ions, and atoms in a sample with the amount of substance in that sample. The numeric value of the Avogadro constant is expressed as the reciprocal of mole.</h1>
<br>
      <br> <br>
      <h1> Brownian Movement</h1>
      <h1> The Brownian movement is one of the significant contributions of Albert Einstein. While studying the molecular theory of liquids, he tried to explain the motion of particles through Brownian motion. This theory explains the random movement of particles in a fluid or gas. Einstein explained the zigzag movement of particles in suspension, and this study aimed to prove the existence of molecules and atoms in particles.</h1>
        
    <br> <br>

    <h1> Quantum Theory of Light</h1>
      <h1> Einstein was the key person behind the quantum theory of light. He proposed and explained that light consists of packets of energy known as photons in 1905. He gave the physical interpretation to Planck’s mathematics when he proposed that electromagnetic radiation itself is granular, consisting of quanta with an energy hf. He also explained the emission of electrons from metals when hit with large electric pulses, like lightning.</h1>
        
    <br> <br>

    <h1> Special Theory of Relativity</h1>
      <h1>The Special Theory of Relativity is also known as special relativity. It is a theory regarding the relationship between time and space. This theory is based on two postulates.

        The laws of physics are the same for all, irrespective of the velocity of the observer.
        The speed of light is always constant, regardless of the motion of the light source or the motion of the observer.
        This theory is one of the reasons to explain the origin of the most famous equation E=mc2
        
        When we hear the mass and energy relationship equation E=mc2, we remember the great scientist Einstein instantaneously. </h1>
        
    <br> <br>

    <h1> General Theory of Relativity</h1>
    <h1> The general theory of relativity generalizes the concepts of Special Relativity, Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation, describing gravity as a property of space and time. It is the geometric theory of gravitation, published in the year 1915. The General Theory of Relativity is also known as General relativity. The general theory of relativity gives the current description of gravitation in modern physics.</h1>
      
  <br> <br>

  <h1> Photoelectric Effect</h1>
  <h1>In 1905, Albert Einstein proposed this theory, which is the base of modern Physics. It is the phenomenon that occurs when the material absorbs electromagnetic radiations and electrically charged particles are released from or within it. In this process, electrons are emitted from the metal plate when light falls on it. The emitted electrons are known as photoelectrons. </h1>
